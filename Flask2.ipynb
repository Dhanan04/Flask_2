    "GET Method: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. It sends data in the URL query string, and the data is visible to everyone in the URL. GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, but they have limitations on the amount of data that can be sent (URL length limit). They are suitable for retrieving data from the server.\n",

POST requests can send large amounts of data, are more secure than GET requests, and are used for submitting forms, uploading files, and other operations where data needs to be hidden"
